* BUG: Lists of crawled URLs from large crawls (1000+ pages), slow down the CMS considerably. Suggest show only partial tree under each "Connector" (or optimise existing and problematic CMS JS)   
* ENHANCEMENT: In addition to the "Number of URLs" total under the "Crawl" tab, modify to show a list of totals for each mime-type or SS type (e.g. SiteTree)

## External Content Module Issues:

* Logic found in StaticSiteTransformResult class should really exist in the external-content module itself.
